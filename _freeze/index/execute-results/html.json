This scientific study focuses on analyzing the Ministry's detailed dataset on restrictive confinement (hereafter **A01RCDD**)[^index-1] for three prior fiscal years via open licensure of the Government of Ontario[@Ontario_SOLGEN_RC_DetailedDataset_2025].\n\n[^index-1]: Dataset file name: a01_restrictive_confinement_detailed_dataset.csv.\n\n## Statistical Machine Learning Policy Effects Estimation\n\nIn explicit terms, the purpose is toward attempts at estimating the policy effect of mental health alerts on the outcome of suicide risk alerts, keeping all other variables constant (covariates of potential confounding nature). Associationally, note that I define the Interactive Regression Model (IRM) and nuisance functions (via DoubleMLIRM) as\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nY &= g_0(D,X) + U, & \\mathbb{E}[U\\mid D,X]=0, \\\\\nD &= m_0(X) + V,   & \\mathbb{E}[V\\mid X]=0, \n\\end{align}\n$$with nuisance functions\n\n$$g_0(d,x):=\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid D=d,X=x], \\qquad m_0(x):=\\mathbb{P}(D=1\\mid X=x),$$ and overlap $\\varepsilon \\le m_0(X)\\le 1-\\varepsilon$ a.s., with learners $ml_g$ and $ml_m$ for estimating $g_0$ and $m_0$ parameter predictions \\[see @Chernozhukov_etal_2018; @doubleml2024R\\]. Furthermore, let\n\n$$\n\\theta_0^{ATE} := \\mathbb{E}!\\left[g_0(1,X)-g_0(0,X)\\right], \\ \\quad\n\\theta_0^{ATTE} := \\mathbb{E}!\\left[g_0(1,X)-g_0(0,X)\\mid D=1\\right].\n$$\n\ndenote the target parameters for predicting the average treatment/policy effect (ATE) and the average policy effect of treated individuals (ATTE), respectively.\n\n### Orthogonal DoubleMLIRM scores\n\nFor the ATE score, let $\\eta=(g,m)$, and the Neyman-orthogonal score [@Chernozhukov_etal_2018; @doubleml2024R] for ATE become\n\n$$\n \\psi^{ATE}(W;\\theta,\\eta) = \\bigl(g(1,X)-g(0,X)\\bigr) +\\frac{D\\,(Y-g(1,X))}{m(X)} -\\frac{(1-D)\\,(Y-g(0,X))}{1-m(X)} -\\theta.\n$$\n\nAdditionally, let $p_0:=\\mathbb{E}[D]$ for the ATTE score, with $g(X):=g_0(0,X)$ as the canonical ATTE score. For $\\eta=(g,m,p)$, let\n\n$$\n\\psi^{ATTE}(W;\\theta,\\eta) = \\frac{D\\,(Y-g(X))}{p} -\\frac{m(X)\\,(1-D)\\,(Y-g(X))}{p\\,(1-m(X))} -\\frac{D}{p},\\theta,\n$$\n\nbe the orthogonal score, where $p=p_0$ [@Chernozhukov_etal_2018 @doubleml2024R].\n\n\n\n### A01-RC Detailed Dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Ontario Restrictive Confinement Dataframe (2023-2025)\n\n|  x1a|x1b      |x1c      |x1d  |x1e      |x1f |x1g |x1h | x1i|\n|----:|:--------|:--------|:----|:--------|:---|:---|:---|---:|\n| 2023|Toronto  |Toronto  |Male |25 to 49 |No  |Yes |No  |   8|\n| 2023|Toronto  |Toronto  |Male |25 to 49 |No  |No  |No  |  26|\n| 2023|Northern |Northern |Male |50+      |No  |No  |No  |  20|\n| 2023|Eastern  |Eastern  |Male |25 to 49 |Yes |Yes |No  |   9|\n| 2023|Western  |Western  |Male |25 to 49 |No  |Yes |No  |  11|\n| 2023|Eastern  |Eastern  |Male |50+      |No  |No  |No  |   8|\n| 2023|Eastern  |Eastern  |Male |50+      |No  |No  |No  |   8|\n| 2023|Central  |Central  |Male |25 to 49 |No  |No  |No  |  10|\n| 2023|Northern |Northern |Male |50+      |No  |No  |No  |   3|\n| 2023|Western  |Western  |Male |25 to 49 |No  |No  |No  |  11|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Research Purpose\n\nThe scientific objective is causal: the study estimates the causal effect of having a mental health alert[^index-2] while preserving the original meanings. Cluster-robust inference is performed at the person identifier[^index-3] on the probability of a suicide risk alert, controlling for demographic and regional covariates. Estimation uses DoubleML’s Interactive Regression Model (IRM) with 3-fold cross-fitting, cluster-robust inference at the person level, and two causal targets: the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATTE). Results are produced both pooled across fiscal years and within fiscal years (year-specific estimates).\n\n[^index-2]: File provenance and variable identification for transparency. The public microdata file analyzed is `a01_restrictive_confinement_detailed_dataset.csv`. Variable definitions, coding, data types, and measurement levels are taken from the supporting Ontario Data Catalogue data dictionary spreadsheet `od-restrictiveconfinement-segregation-deaths-dd20251103.xlsx` (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/09f7fc65-d3bb-4ca8-8b84-1cdc3ef73c36/resource/d83fe893-9634-4794-a0c1-c17bf619a95a/download/od-restrictiveconfinement-segregation-deaths-dd20251103.xlsx); the project file `ao1rc_information.csv` is a convenience extract of the `a01` rows from that spreadsheet and is not the primary citation. The October 31, 2025 update documentation is stored as `dataupdatenote.docx`. Dataset column names (as published) are: `EndFiscalYear`, `UniqueIndividual_ID`, `Region_AtTimeOfPlacement`, `Region_MostRecentPlacement`, `Gender`, `Age_Category`, `MentalHealth_Alert` (treatment $D$), `SuicideRisk_Alert` (outcome $Y$), `SuicideWatch_Alert`, and `Number_Of_Placements`. For analysis, column names were standardized using `janitor` (e.g., `MentalHealth_Alert` $\\rightarrow$ `mental_health_alert`) while preserving the original meanings. Cluster-robust inference is performed at the person identifier `UniqueIndividual_ID`.\n\n[^index-3]: As per documentation, it is inferred that the data structure is of repeated measures albeit only tracked within each year and thus, not between the three years, in tandem. The aforementioned can be stipulated due to privacy legislations and policy regulations on the unique individual ids (`UniqueIndividual_ID`), indicating a limitation for conducting longitudinal tests of the dataset, albeit the workaround considered here is through Double/Debiased Machine Learning.",
